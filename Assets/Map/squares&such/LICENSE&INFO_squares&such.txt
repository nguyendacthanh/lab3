_________ How to _________

I first created these shapes as symbol libraries, to be imported in the free drawing software Krita.
To import them in Krita 5.1, go to "Settings", select "Manage Resources".
In the window that opens, click on "Import Resources". Choose the SVG file you want to import.
When Krita asks you which kind of resource the file you just imported is, select "Symbol Libraries".
Now find (or open) the "Symbol Libraries" docker to check if your import worked.
(Don't worry if the shapes appear pixelated in the docker preview)
Clicking on one symbol and dragging it onto the drawing area will automatically create a new vector layer.

The symbols in the SVG file are scalable to the size of your wish in vector graphics editing softwares, such as Inkscape (free), Adobe Illustrator or Affinity Designer.
Alternatively, open the file in an IDE and modify the SVG code directly.
